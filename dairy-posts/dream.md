Ladies and gentlemen, and all lovers of lactic lore,

I stand before you today, not to milk your sympathy, but to churn the buttery dreams of dairy equality. A curdled consciousness has gripped our nation, a nation built on the cream of the crop, where every cow and every goat is created equal in the eyes of the cheeseboard.

I have a creamy dream that one day, on the rolling hills of Wisconsin, sons of former milkmaids and sons of former cheese artisans will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood, enjoying a platter of mozzarella sticks and queso dip, regardless of their curd size or curdling origin.

I have a dream that one day, in the state of Vermont, little cottage cheeses and aged cheddars will be able to join hands with little creamers as sisters and brothers, coexisting in harmony amidst the bubbling fondue fountains.

I have a dream that my four little creamers will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the creaminess of their consistency but by the content of their flavor profiles.

I have a dream today!

I have a dream that one day, down in Georgia, with its sweltering heat and simmering grits, a Gouda wheel and a Brie wedge will be able to melt together in a symphony of unity, transcending the labels and markers of the dairy aisle.

I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made level, and the lactic acids will flow like a river of prosperity, enriching the soils of our collective palate.

And when this happens, when we let the curd of compassion flow, when we allow the milk of human kindness to overflow its container, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, cheeses and yogurts, butter and cream, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old dairy spiritual, "Free at last! Free at last! Thank Cheeses, we are free at last!"
